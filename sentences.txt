Coding like poetry should be short and concise.
It’s not a bug; it’s an undocumented feature.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: feedback is the treatment.
Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
